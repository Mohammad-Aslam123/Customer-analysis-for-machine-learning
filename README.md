# Customer-analysis-for-machine-learning

Introduction

This project has been done in fulfillment to the Capstone Project requirement of Entri Elevate's Data Science and Machine Learning Program.
In the highly competitive business environment, understanding customer behavior is crucial for the success of a company. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior for a well-known company with numerous products. By examining historical data, we aim to build a model that can predict whether customers will accept marketing campaigns and classify them into different segments based on their behavior.

Objectives

1.Predict Campaign Acceptance: Develop a classification model to predict whether customers will accept marketing campaigns.
2.Customer Segmentation: Create clusters of customers based on their behavior and characteristics to identify distinct segments.
3.Insight Discovery: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights within the data.
4.Evaluation and Improvement: Evaluate the performance of the models and propose next steps for improvements.
